overfitting: The classifier adapts too closely to specific properties of the training data, rather than the underlying distribution

Cross Validation Procedure (tuning paramater gamma):
split train set validation set and test set
train each gamma on train set
Validat on validation set and choose smallest gamma
tain on train set + validation set
report error on test set


K-fold
set aside test set
split train set into k block
use each block in turn as validation set
cpmpute the cv estimate risk  (mean of risk on block k with classifier trainied on the rest)
report error on test set

K=n : leave one out cross validation    loocv

Common recommendation: K = 5 to K = 10
