A tree classifier is a binary tree in which:
      Each inner node is a rule of the form xi > ti.
      The threshold values ti are the parameters which specify the tree.
      Each leaf is a class label
      
classification: for rigion R_m classfy as the most occured
splitting: split Rm to Rm1 and Rm2
cost of split: Q = propotion of missclaffication after the split

training step:
for each rigion R_m, for each axis find best split point t_h, and choose the beat axis j, then split from axis j at t_j
                best in terms of min Q

Definictions:
decision stump:  tree classifier of depth 1  (j,tj)

will need so use esemble methods
