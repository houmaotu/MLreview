val from last layer weighted sum to next layer, compute by activation g, get val of this layer and send to next layer ....

Loss function, typicallyy cross entrophe ylog (y) + (1- y) log (1-y)

computation:
perform gradient descent with Backpropagation(basically chain rule) to reduce huge computational cost
