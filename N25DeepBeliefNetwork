explaining away
x->z<-y    x y idep but x|z y|z are not indep
coursequence: layer givev prev indep, given subsequent not indep

complementary prior: prior as a layer "cancel out" independency:
      for resersible Markov Chain   the stationsay state is the prior   or (RMB)
      
claim:     Using an “infinitely deep” graphical model given by the Gibbs sampler for the RBM as a
            prior is equivalent to using the Y-layer of the RBM as a prior.
            

summary:
    first two layer: RMB prior undirected   but can roll off to deep directed gibbs
    other laters: drected
