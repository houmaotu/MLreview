model order selectionï¼š deter number of clusters
Approaches:
Penalization approaches (only MLE overfits), Stability(resumpling), Bayesian methods(acts like penailzation)


Penalization approache:
    min -log L + phi(m)
    AIC  m
    BIC 1/2 mlon(n)    this penilize more
    
 Stability:
 split to X' X''  get mixture pi' pi''
 compute haed assignmens m' m'' using pi' pi'' on X''
 score (K) = min(m' !=m'') under all permutations   (do the two mixtures get the same result?)
 
 exp family
 
p = h(x)/Z(theta) exp(<S(x),theta>)
