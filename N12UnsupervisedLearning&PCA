UnsupervisedLearning = label not avail e.g. clusteringï¼Œ  dimsntion reduction

dimention reduction:
Project high dim to low dim

Principal Component Analysis:
    empirical covariance matrix of the data
    eigen val eigen vec of matrix
    choose d largest eigen val lambda 1-d
    parject onto the span of eigen vec psi 1-d 
    
 Idea max the variance of the projected data  x_iv = sum_j <x_i,psi_j> psj

pca as optimization problem
max <v,Sigma v>          variance of  projected data
s.t. ||v|| = 1


The first few eigenvectors are called principal components
Application: Lossy data compression

number of principal components choice: usually 2 or 3   or curve eigen val jumo down

Note:
data have to be centered 
date usually need to be scaled
