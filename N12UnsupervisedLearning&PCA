UnsupervisedLearning = label not avail e.g. clusteringï¼Œ  dimsntion reduction

dimention reduction:
Project high dim to low dim

Principal Component Analysis:
    empirical covariance matrix of the data
    eigen val eigen vec of matrix
    choose d largest eigen val
    paoject onto the span of eigen vec
    
 Idea max the variance of the projected data

pca as optimization problem
max <v,Sigma v>          variance of  projected data
s.t. ||v|| = 1


The first few eigenvectors are called principal components
Application: Lossy data compression
