neighborhood graph: N = (V_n,W_n) neighbors edge weights

Markov property: distribuction only depends on neighbors

Markov random field undirected graphical model with Markov property

e.g. p(x) = 1/Z exp(-H(x))  H is energy function can be paramatrized

clique: fully connected subgraph

THM:  Markov random fields factorize over cliques.

Potts model: p(theta) \propto exp(beta sum w_ij I (theta_i != theta_j))

Ising model: w_ij = 1

MRFs can be used as smooothing priors (spatial smoothing)
